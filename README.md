This repository demonstrates a common error in COBOL programs involving the REDEFINES clause.  The `bug.cob` file contains a program that moves alphanumeric data into a field redefined as numeric, which can lead to unexpected behavior.  The `bugSolution.cob` provides a corrected version with appropriate data type handling.  The issue is that directly displaying numeric data after assigning alphanumeric values without proper data conversion can lead to runtime errors or misinterpretations of the output.  The solution highlights the importance of data type consistency when using REDEFINES.
